        <h2>Key Components of eBuds</h2>

        <h3>DAO Governance</h3>
        <p>eBuds operates as a fully decentralized autonomous organization on <a href="https://peerme.io/ebudsdac">PeerMe</a>
, meaning decisions and developments within the ecosystem are made by the community, for the community. Governance is facilitated through NFTs, allowing holders to vote on proposals, influence the direction of the project, and ensure that the platform evolves in line with the community’s needs.</p>

        <h3>EBUD Token</h3>
        <p>The primary utility token within the eBuds ecosystem. EBUD is designed to be scarce. The token’s primary role is to provide liquidity to its members, fostering growth and active participation in blockchain technology.</p>

        <h3>LUV Token</h3>
        <p>The LUV token serves as a secondary token within the eBuds ecosystem, with a much bigger supply, initially launched on Jexchange, LUV is designed to complement the EBUD token, offering enhanced security and promoting community engagement through its unique ethos.</p>

        <h3>NFTs</h3>
        <p>NFTs play a crucial role in the eBuds ecosystem. Not only do they serve as governance tools within the DAO, but they also offer unique staking opportunities that enhance user rewards. The eBuds NFT collection allows holders to stake their NFTs to earn additional rewards in the form of EBUD tokens.</p>
